What does it mean to study literature today? In this course, we will begin to outline the inner
and outer boundaries of the field. To this end, the MA seminar first provides a systematic
overview of recent and historical developments in Anglophone literary studies. Second, we aim
to foster familiarity with established professional genres, norms, and practices. Finally, the
course is meant to welcome students into the intellectual life of the English department at
Columbia, fostering a sense of dialogue and community among faculty and students. Participants
should expect to read several article- or chapter-length works weekly, contribute to the
seminar discussion online and in person, and to complete several written assignments, paving
the way to a successful completion of the degree program.
