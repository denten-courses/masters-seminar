## English and Comparative Literature Masters Seminar

```
Fall 2019 English GR5001 Section 002 Dennis Yi Tenen
Office Hours, Friday 11--1pm, Philosophy 408e (email to confirm availability)
```

This MA seminar (1) provides an episodic overview of developments in Anglophone literary
studies, (2) introduces students to advanced research methods in the field, and (3) develops
familiarity with professional norms and practices.

Since these topics greatly exceed the capacity of a single semester, our goal will be to
establish a framework that will continue to grow and consolidate throughout your professional
career. Each week we will read and discuss several essays (stand-alone or book chapters),
representative of a decade---starting with the turn of the twentieth century and ending in the
twenty-first. Some of these will turn out to be canonical, while others represent still
inchoate directions for future research. Throughout we will pay attention not only to what is
being said, but how. I am interested here in the *work* of literary scholarship---its expertise
and possibilities as a discipline.

Students should expect to participate actively in weekly discussions, in-class and online, and
to complete regular short written skill-building assignments.  Together, we will reflect on the
morphology of common academic forms---such as the essay, book, conference paper, journal,
archive, and press---as well as share effective strategies for brainstorming, researching,
organizing, writing, editing, and bringing your projects to completion.

**Grading Requirements**

- 25% Participation (class + online)
- 50% Written Assignments
- 25% Final Presentation

**Modalities of Engagement**

- We will seek to create a respectful and supportive environment for our community. Consult the
  xpMethods [lab-culture][1] document for core principles.

- Please *bring a paper copy* of each reading to the class. The use of electronic devices will
be limited to specific exercises.

- Links to most readings will be provided. However, you are ultimately responsible for
  procuring the reading materials. Whenever possible, seek documents *in context* of their
publication. I also strongly encourage that you purchase those texts that are relevant to your
interests.

- We will not always have time to discuss every text assigned. Regardless, you are responsible
  for the entirety of the material. Pursue your curiosity by expanding the selection to cover
TOCs, introductions, and conclusions.

- When not feeling well, you have the option to engage from home. Rest and recover before
  coming back to class, especially during the flu season. There is no penalty for doing so. An
absence for any reason can always be remedied through online participation above the weekly
minimum.

- Consult Columbia's guidelines on [Academic Integrity and Responsible Conduct of Research][2].
