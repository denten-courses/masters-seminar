## English and Comparative Literature Masters Seminar
`Fall 2020 English GR5001 Section 001 Dennis Yi Tenen`

This MA seminar (1) provides an episodic overview of developments in Anglophone literary
studies, (2) introduces students to advanced research methods in the field, and (3) develops
familiarity with professional norms and practices.

Since these topics greatly exceed the capacity of a single semester, our goal will be to
establish a framework that will continue to grow and consolidate throughout your professional
career. Each week we will read and discuss several essays (stand-alone or book chapters),
representative of a decade---starting with the turn of the twentieth century and ending in the
twenty-first. Some of these will turn out to be canonical, while others represent still
inchoate directions for future research. Throughout we will pay attention not only to what is
being said, but how. I am interested here in the *work* of literary scholarship---its expertise
and possibilities as a discipline.

Students should expect to participate actively in weekly discussions, in-class and online, and
to complete regular short written skill-building assignments.  Together, we will reflect on the
morphology of common academic forms---such as the essay, book, conference paper, journal,
archive, and press---as well as share effective strategies for brainstorming, researching,
organizing, writing, editing, and bringing your projects to completion.

**Grading Requirements**
