This MA seminar (1) provides a selective overview of representative developments in Anglophone
literary studies, (2) introduces students to advanced research methods in the field, and (3)
develops familiarity with professional norms and practices.

Since these topics greatly exceed the capacity of a single semester, our goal will be to
establish a framework that will continue to grow and consolidate throughout your professional
career. Each week we will read and discuss several essays (stand-alone or book chapters),
representative of a decade---starting with the turn of the twentieth century and ending in the
twenty-first.

Students should expect to participate actively in weekly discussions, in-class and online, and
to complete regular short written skill-building assignments.  Together, we will reflect on the
morphology of common academic forms---such as the essay, book, conference paper, journal,
archive, and press---as well as share effective strategies for brainstorming, researching,
organizing, writing, editing, and bringing your projects to completion.
