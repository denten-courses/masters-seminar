This MA seminar (1) provides a selective overview of major developments in
Anglophone literary studies, (2) introduces students to advanced research
methods in the field, and (3) develops familiarity with professional norms and
practices.

Since these topics greatly exceed the capacity of a single semester, our goal
will be to establish a framework that will continue to grow and consolidate
throughout your professional career. Each week we will read and discuss
several essays (stand-alone or book chapters), representative of a
decade---starting with the turn of the twentieth century and ending in the
twenty-first.

Students should expect to participate actively in weekly discussions, in-class
and online, and to complete regular short written skill-building assignments.
Together, we will reflect on the morphology of common academic forms---such as
the essay, book, conference paper, journal, archive, and press---as well as
share effective strategies for brainstorming, researching, organizing,
writing, editing, and bringing your projects to completion.
